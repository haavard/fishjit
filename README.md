fishjit
=======
fishjit is a just-in-time compiler for the [><>][1] esoteric programming
language. It is written in C using the [DynASM][2] dynamic assembler.
Currently only supports the amd64 architecture.

Known limitations:
 - No i386 support
 - Instructions `p` and `g` not implemented
 - Code is maximally 256 by 256 characters
 - Lots and lots of bugs

Installation
------------
fishjit requires the [uthash][3] hash table library. DynASM is included via a
git submodule.

    $ git clone https://github.com/haavardp/fishjit.git
    $ cd fishjit
    $ git submodule update --init
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

To run the included tests, run `make check`.

Example
-------
    $ cat helloworld.fish
    !v"hello, world"ar!
     >l?!;o
    $ fish helloworld.fish
    hello, world
