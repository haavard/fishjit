=======
fishjit is a just-in-time compiler for the [><>][1] esoteric programming
language. It is written in C using [DynASM][2] for emitting code. Currently
only supports the amd64 architecture on Linux.

Known limitations:
 - No i386 support
 - Instructions `p` and `g` not implemented
 - Instructions `[` and `]` not implemented
 - Code is maximally 256 by 256 characters

Installation
------------
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/haavardp/fishjit.svg?token=q1REyqE9bXXeo3BE68D1&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/haavardp/fishjit)

fishjit requires the [uthash][3] library and [LuaJIT][4] (or possibly plain
Lua with the [BitOp extension][5]) when building. Bash is required for running
tests.

    $ git clone https://github.com/haavardp/fishjit.git
    $ cd fishjit
    $ git submodule update --init
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

To run the included tests, run `make check`.

Example
-------
    $ cat helloworld.fish
    !v"hello, world"ar!
     >l?!;o
    $ fishjit helloworld.fish
    hello, world

More examples can be found under the "tests" directory.
